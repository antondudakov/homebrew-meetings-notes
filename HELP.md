## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Transcription Quality

‚úÖ **Use a good microphone** - Built-in Mac mic works, but external is better
‚úÖ **Reduce background noise** - Close windows, turn off fans
‚úÖ **Speak clearly** - Normal pace, don't rush
‚úÖ **Position mic properly** - 6-12 inches from your mouth
‚úÖ **Test first** - Do a 30-second test recording to verify audio levels

### For System Audio Capture

‚úÖ **Grant screen recording permission** - Required for system audio
‚úÖ **Check audio levels** - System level meter should show activity when others speak
‚úÖ **Use headphones** - Prevents echo/feedback
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** System audio only captures when using built-in audio output, not Bluetooth

### For Better Summaries

‚úÖ **Longer meetings** - Summaries work best with 10+ minutes of content
‚úÖ **Clear structure** - Meetings with clear topics/decisions get better summaries
‚úÖ **Wait for completion** - Summary generation takes 30-60 seconds, be patient
‚úÖ **Review and edit** - Summaries are AI-generated, review for accuracy
